## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **pnpm**: This project uses pnpm as the package manager
- **Git**: For version control

### Fork and Clone

2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wc-toolkit/cem-sorter
cd cem-sorter
```

## Development Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Build the project:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

3. Run tests to ensure everything is working:

```bash

```

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Create a descriptive branch name for your changes:

- `feature/add-new-sorting-option`
- `fix/handle-undefined-names`
- `docs/update-readme-examples`
- `refactor/improve-performance`

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes in the `src/` directory

3. Build and test your changes:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run test
```

4. Run the demo to test functionality:

```bash
pnpm run demo
```

5. Lint and format your code:

```bash
pnpm run lint:fix
pnpm run format
```

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm run build` - Build the TypeScript source to JavaScript
- `pnpm run test` - Run the test suite
- `pnpm run lint` - Check for linting errors
- `pnpm run lint:fix` - Fix automatically fixable linting errors
- `pnpm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm run demo` - Run the demo script
- `pnpm run clean` - Clean build artifacts

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
pnpm run test
```

### Writing Tests

- Tests are located in `src/cem-sorter.test.ts`
- We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as our testing framework
- Write tests for any new functionality or bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting your PR

### Test Structure

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { sortCem } from "./cem-sorter.js";

describe("your feature", () => {
  it("should do something specific", () => {
    // Arrange
    const manifest = createMockManifest();
    
    // Act
    const result = sortCem(manifest, options);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toEqual(expectedResult);
  });
});
```

## Code Style

### ESLint and Prettier

This project uses ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting. The configuration is already set up, and you can run:

```bash
pnpm run lint:fix
pnpm run format
```

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict TypeScript settings
- Provide proper type annotations for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions

### Code Quality

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**: Ensure any new features are documented in the README.md

2. **Add Tests**: Include tests for new functionality

3. **Update Changelog**: Add an entry describing your changes

4. **Create Pull Request**: 
   - Use a descriptive title
   - Include a detailed description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots if applicable

## Release Process

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management and publishing.

When making changes to the repo, be sure to add a changeset. Once it's merged into main, it will automatically trigger a release.

```bash
pnpm changeset add
```
